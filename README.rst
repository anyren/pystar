PyStar - Programming Workshops for Women and Their Friends
==========================================================

The PyStar program is a workshop designed to teach women and their friends who are 
looking to learn how to program in a friendly non-alpha-geek environment. Currently there 
are PyStar events taking place in Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and the Bay Area as well as similar
workshops in Boston and LA.  To organaize events using this curriculum or to add to it in any way

About
=====
   
Goal
----

The PyStar program is a workshop designed to teach 
women (including trans women) and their friends 
who are looking to learn how to program in a friendly non-alpha-geek
environment. The goal of this program is to increase the number
of women in computer programming, especially in the Python language which is
considered to be a very approachable language to get started with.

Pedagogy
--------

The approach for this workshop is to have groups learning together
with at least one guide or instructor who can lead where needed, 
and help out as requested while participants work through 
badges at their level of learning. At present there are two streams for the one-day workshop
participants: Learning to Program or Web Application (using Django).  One is more of a focus on the 
basics of programming and is well suited to students with
very little experience in programming.  The other is a bit more 
involved and will require network access as it includes putting a Django site
up on the web.

Future
---------

As these workshops begin to happen it is hoped that attendees will
come back as assistants in future workshops with the end goal
of having former participants become guides/instructors at 
future workshops.  There may be a disproportionate amount of
male teachers at initial workshops which is why we are encouraging participants
to come back and take the lead as soon as they feel ready.

TODO
----

- arrange for distributed updates to pystar website
- more badges at different levels of programming (tiered badges)
- clean up & improve Windows set up instructions
- modularize (or turn into badges) the Django web app
