Badges
=========

PyStar is a **self-directed learning environment** where you will learn at your own pace and work on the badges you want to work on. You may not finish any of the badges, and that's okay! You might work on things that aren't in badges and that's okay too! The only requirements (or strong suggestions) are to complete the set-up and work through the intro.
